# MOPS
- First HW is for processing navigation signals and defining optimal signal parameters estimations
- Second HW consists of 2 tasks: 
  - Kalman's filtering for radio-signal's parameters
  - Dependence of RMS error of frequency filtering on SNR/ Dependence of the optimal bandwidth of the frequency locked loop system on SNR; -//- for dependency on RMS of acceleration changes
- Third and forth are Kalman's filtering of radio-navigational parameters
